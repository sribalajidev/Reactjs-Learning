# Functional Components in React

## 1. What are Functional Components?

Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX to render UI.
They were traditionally stateless, but with React Hooks, functional components can now handle state, lifecycle events, and side effects, making them as powerful as class components.

**Syntax:**
```jsx
// Basic functional component
function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

**ES6 arrow function version:**
```jsx
const HelloWorld = () => <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
```

## 2. Why Use Functional Components?

- Simpler and cleaner syntax compared to class components.
- Easier to read, write, and maintain.
- Fully compatible with React Hooks for state and side effects.
- Promotes reusability and modular code.

## 3. Commonly Used React Hooks

Functional components use hooks to manage state and side effects:
| Hook          | Purpose                                                   | Example / Use Case                                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useState`    | Manage state in functional components                     | Counter, form input value, toggle UI                              |
| `useEffect`   | Handle side effects like API calls, timers, subscriptions | Fetch API data on mount, countdown timer, updating document title |
| `useRef`      | Access DOM elements or persist mutable values             | Focusing input fields, storing previous state                     |
| `useMemo`     | Memoize expensive computations                            | Optimizing performance in large lists                             |
| `useCallback` | Memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders       | Event handlers passed to child components                         |
| `useContext`  | Consume context for global state                          | Theme, authentication, user settings                              |

| Component                | Functionality / POC                    | Notes                                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Syntax.jsx`             | Basic functional component syntax      | Demonstrates returning JSX                       |
| `Props.jsx`              | Passing props from parent              | Dynamic rendering using props                    |
| `State.jsx`              | Using `useState`                       | Increment/Decrement counter, toggle UI           |
| `Effect.jsx`             | Countdown timer with `useEffect`       | Lifecycle-like behavior in functional components |
| `EffectsAPI.jsx`         | Fetch API data using `useEffect`       | Real-world API list rendering                    |
| `EventHandling.jsx`      | Handle button clicks & input changes   | Practical event examples                         |
| `DefaultProps.jsx`       | Default values for props               | Ensures safe fallback when props not passed      |
| `PropTypeValidation.jsx` | Prop validation                        | Prevents bugs by enforcing prop types            |
| `NestedComponents.jsx`   | Parent-child components                | Component composition & reusability              |
| `POC.jsx`                | Countdown timer with start/pause/reset | Real-world interview-style POC                   |

## 5. Differences from Class Components
| Feature     | Class Component                                | Functional Component                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Syntax      | `class Component extends React.Component`      | `function Component()`                   |
| State       | `this.state` & `this.setState`                 | `useState` hook                          |
| Lifecycle   | `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` etc. | `useEffect` hook                         |
| Binding     | Manual `this` binding for methods              | No binding required, use arrow functions |
| Boilerplate | More verbose, more code                        | Simpler, concise, readable               |

## 6. Pros of Functional Components

- Shorter, cleaner code
- Easier to read and maintain
- Full support for hooks (state, side effects)
- No need for `this` binding
- Encourages modular and reusable code
- Better performance in some cases due to simpler React internals

---

## 7. Cons of Functional Components

- Some older React features or third-party libraries may still prefer class components
- Slightly less intuitive for developers coming from OOP background

---

## 8. Real-World Use Cases & Projects

**Modern React projects prefer functional components because of:**
- Hooks provide cleaner state and lifecycle management
- Easier to split UI into smaller reusable components
- Works well with modern state management libraries like Redux Toolkit, Recoil, or Zustand

**Real-world examples:**
- Dashboards & Admin Panels: Component-based modular UI, API integration
- E-commerce websites: Product cards, filters, dynamic lists
- Blogs & CMS: Nested components for articles, comments, and user profile
- Quiz/Timer apps: Countdown timer with hooks (like our POC example)
- Social media apps: Feed updates using `useEffect` for API calls

---

## 9. Summary

Functional components are now the preferred standard in React development.
- They are simpler, reusable, and hook-friendly
- Hooks replace class lifecycle methods, enabling state and side effects
- Most modern React projects use functional components exclusively
- With POC examples, you can see real-world applications like timers, API lists, event handling, nested components, and default props
